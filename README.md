# README: Game Theory Course at the University of Oregon

## Course Overview

This document provides an overview of the Game Theory course that I designed and taught at the University of Oregon. The course was created to introduce students to the essential concepts and applications of game theory, exploring strategic interactions among rational decision-makers through various models, including cooperative and non-cooperative games.

I was assigned this course by the Department of Economics at the University of Oregon. I designed and implemented the course entirely, ensuring it met academic standards and provided a comprehensive understanding of game theory.
