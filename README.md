# Game Theory (EC 327) at the University of Oregon

## Overview
This repository contains the files and data related to the Game Theory course that I designed and taught at the University of Oregon. The course was created to introduce students to the essential concepts and applications of game theory, exploring strategic interactions among rational decision-makers through various models, including simultaneous, sequential, Bayesian, cooperative, and non-cooperative games.

I was assigned this course by the Department of Economics at the University of Oregon. I designed and implemented the course entirely, ensuring it met academic standards and provided a comprehensive understanding of game theory.
